# NoFakeNews
Playground developed using Swift and SwiftUI. Submitted to WWDC.

This playground is called No Fake News, and it was developed mainly for children and their parents. Nowadays, children are having access to the internet, and all the information available at it, sooner than years ago.  With that amount of information available at the palm of their hands, it is really important that these children are oriented about the perks and the risks that exist online. When I was younger, I often heard that I should not trust everything that I read online, and I grew up being very careful with that. However, not everyone has that kind of orientation at a young age. 


Fake News are a big problem in our society today. It seems that people just spread what they receive without even considering the source and the veracity of that. What if it was possible to teach those people, specially at a young age, on how to identify a possible false news and stop them of spreading more rumors and chain messages? It was with this in mind that I have developed this playground. 


The content of this playground was partially based on a material from the Brazilian Internet Management Committee (CGI.br). The original material is called Secure Internet ('Internet Segura' in Portuguese) and follows a Creative Commons license, allowing anyone to use it with no commercial purposes.


This playground was developed thinking about the information that was going to be passed on, but also about the experience of the children using it. Therefore, it has a few informative pages about how to spot if a message received is a fake news, and in the end there is game to test the acquired knowledge. 


The game is a “complete the sentences” test, where in order to complete the sentences, the user should drag the words available and drop them in the right place. If the words are placed correctly, it will be shown to the user. 


All the code is inside the UserModule, and it is displayed in the main page called No Fake News. To navigate through the playground, just use the buttons that will apear as you go on. 


For a better experience, please play it in full screen and hide the editor. You may also hide the sidebar.
